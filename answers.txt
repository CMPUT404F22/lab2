Question 1
You can specify a tcp socket in python with the SOCK_STREAM constant in the 'socket' module.

Question 2
A server socket listens for incoming connections and a client socket initiates connection to a server socket.

Question 4
What information do we get about incoming connections?
When we receive an incoming connection, we have access to the corresponding socket object that allows us
to send and receive data over the connection. We also know the address of the incoming connection.

Question 5
What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
It returns the encoded data (string) received from the other end of the socket.
